This repo is in very early stage (pre-pre Alpha) and it's in heavy redesign/recode. Please expect:
+ Error all over the place
+ no comment/in code documentation
+ API changes/inconsistencies
+ Unused vars/type/function etc.
+ no timeline for all of this to be done

However, I have a design in mind to elaborate most (if not all) of the Colored Petri Nets (CPN) along with Stochstic Petri Nets properties. There's also a plan to extend some properties to support modelling of todays technology, like state's storage options, from only Multisets to also have chanel (FIFO) and stacks (LIFO), interior nets, scripting for transition execution/arc expression etc.
